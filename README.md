Credits to Wentao Shi for the initial skeleton of this project. 

For use: pretrain.csv should be replaced with csv downloaded from the PubChem database. finetune.csv should be replaced with whichever compounds you wish to use for finetuning (Example is KRAS-G12C Inhibitors as that was the focus of this project)

This model can generate hundreds of thousands of valid SMILES (compounds) at a near 100% accuracy.
